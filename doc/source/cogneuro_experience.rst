Cognitive neuroscience experience
=================================
This documentation is not a tutorial on how to pre-process cognitive neuroscience data; it is assumed that the user is already familiar with these.

We argue that an *fMRI* users should be at least at the *advanced beginner level*, meaning they should:

- be able to preprocess data (e.g. motion correction, slice time correction, signal normalization).
- be able to create a mask of either the whole brain or regions of interest.
- be able to run the General Linear Model (GLM) to get beta estimates and t-statistics.
    + this includes running the GLM on each run seperately, or on half of the runs (e.g., even and odd).
- understand the basic ideas behind MVPA.

There is currently no support for *MEEG*, although we hope to add it in the future.
