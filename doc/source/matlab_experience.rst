Matlab experience
=================

CoSMoMVPA_ is written with simplicity and mind, and therefore does not require one to be a Matlab expert. However, some minimal knowledge is required. To assess your knowledge of Matlab, below we describe some (subjectively chosen) criteria. 

Using these criteria, we would argue that using CoSMoMVPA to analyze your data requires at least the *advanced beginner* level. In order to understand the internal functionalities, and/or to contribute code, the *competent* level is required, while the *proficient* level is preferable. 

Advanced beginner
+++++++++++++++++
The advanced beginner should know be familiar with:

- starting and exiting Matlab
- modifying the Matlab path.
- ``array``, ``cell`` and ``struct`` data objects, and how to store data in and retrieve data from these.
- difference between a ``numeric``, ``character`` and ``boolean`` data type.
- difference between a ``script`` and a ``function``.
- using a ``function``, and see the ``help`` documentation associated with a function.
- be familiar with ``for`` and ``while`` loops.
- understand the ``if`` statement.

Competent user
++++++++++++++
In addition, the *competent* user should be familiar with:

- function handles.
- allocating memory for data.
- difference between using a binary mask and indices to access values in a ``cell`` or ``struct``.
- linear and subscripts to access values in a ``cell`` or ``struct``.
- ``varargin`` and ``nargin``.
- perform basic string manipulations.

Proficient user
+++++++++++++++
In addition, the *proficient* user should be familar with:

- nested function handles and Currying.
- ``bsxfun``.
- recursion.
- assessing space- and time complexity of an algorithm.
- all there is to know about data structures and their limiations.
- basic linear algebra.
- using linear indexing whenever possible.
- modular design of functions. 
- namespaces and closures.
- profiling.
- unit testing.
- ``git``.


(We have no idea what an *expert* user should be able to do, because we don't consider ourselves in that category).
