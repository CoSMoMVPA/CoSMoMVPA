Frequently Asked/Anticipated Questions

**What is the history of CoSMoMVPA?**

    CoSMoMVPA was started when Gunnar Blohm and Sara Fabri invited the developers (ACC and NNO) to speak at the *2013 Summer School in Computational Sensory-Motor Neuroscience* ( `CoSMo 2013 workshop`_ ) about multivariate pattern analysis methods.

    In a few days they wrote the basic functionality including the dataset structure (inspired by PyMVPA_), basic input/output support for the NIFTI format, correlation analysis, several classifiers, cross-validation, and representational similarity analysis. They also decided to use restructured text to build a website, and wrote a custom build script to generate documentation for the website, including multiple versions of Matlab files to generate both exercises files (with some code to be filled in) and solution files (with all the code).

    Their plan was to let participants write a basic MVPA toolbox in two days (see the :ref:`exercises <cosmo2013>`). This was, with hindsight, a tad ambitious.

    The initial components in CoSMoMVPA_ still stand, but quite a few things have changed in the meantime. CoSMoMVPA has added support for various file formats, including surface-based data and MEEG data. It also supports a wider range of analyses. Finally, there is a new set of :ref:`exercises <cimec2014>`, less aimed at writing your own toolbox, but more at understanding and implementing basic MVPA techniques using CoSMoMVPA_.

**What, yet another MVPA toolbox? How is this toolbox different from others?**
    Indeed, another MVPA toolbox, featuring:

    + *Simple*, *light-weight*, and *modular* Matlab_ / Octave_ functions .
    + Provides implementations of *all common MVPA analyses* for (correlations, representational similarity, classifiers, crossvalidation, searchlight analysis).
    + Supports volumetric fMRI, surface-based fMRI, and MEEG data alike.
    + Provides :ref:`searchlight <cosmo_searchlight>` functionality for :ref:`volumetric <demo_fmri_searchlight_lda>`, :ref:`surface-based <demo_surface_searchlight_lda>`, MEEG :ref:`time-locked <demo_meeg_timelock_searchlight>`, and :ref:`time-frequency <demo_meeg_timefreq_searchlight>` data.
    + Supports measuring :ref:`generalization over time <demo_meeg_timeseries_generalization>` (or any other dimension), either in an ROI or through a searchlight.
    + Support a variety of formats:

        * fMRI volumetric (:ref:`cosmo_fmri_dataset` and :ref:`cosmo_map2fmri`): AFNI_, BrainVoyager_, ANALYZE, NIFTI_. It can also load ``SPM.mat`` files from SPM_.
        * fMRI surface-based (:ref:`cosmo_surface_dataset` and :ref:`cosmo_map2surface`): Brainvoyager, AFNI (NIML).
        * MEEG (:ref:`cosmo_meeg_dataset` and :ref:`cosmo_map2meeg`): Fieldtrip, EEGLab.

    + Provides proper cluster-based :ref:`multiple comparison correction functionality <cosmo_montecarlo_cluster_stat>` (:ref:`example <demo_surface_tfce>`), using either Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement or traditional cluster-size based Monte Carlo simulations.
    + Runs on both Matlab_ and GNU Octave_.
    + Various runnable :ref:`example scripts <contents_demo.rst>` and :ref:`exerices <cimec2014>`, describing both on how to perform certain types of analyses (i.e., from a user perspective), and on how typical MVP analyses can be implemented (from a programmer persective).

    For comparison, here is a list of other MVPA toolboxes:

    + PyMVPA_ is implemented in Python (it provided inspiration for the dataset structure and semantics). Our toolbox implements the most commonly used MVP analyses (but not all of them) in Matlab. Those who are familiar with Matlab but not with Python may find CoSMoMVPA easier to use.
    + PRoNTo_ is another Matlab MVPA toolbox, that is much wider in scope and provies a Graphical User Interface. In contrast, our toolbox is more aimed on the analysis itself rather than providing a GUI, meaning it has much fewer lines of code and is simpler in design. This may make it easier to understand its functions, and to modify.
    + Searchmight_ is aimed at searchlight analyses (and does these very fast). CoSMoMVPA does support such analyses (:ref:`example <demo_fmri_searchlight_naive_bayes>`, but also supports other types of analyses not covered by Searchmight.
    + `Princeton MVPA`_ toolbox is a sophisticated toolbox but (we think) harder to use, and is currently not under active development.


**What does CoSMoMVPA *not* provide?**
    It does not provide (and probably never will):

    + Preprocessing of data. For fMRI data it assumed that the data has been preprocessed and, in most use-case scenarios, has been analyzed using the General Linear Model.
    + Implementations of complicated analyses (such as hyperalignment, nested cross validation, recursive feature elimination). If you want to do these, consider using PyMVPA_.
    + A Graphical User Interface (GUI). First, it's a lot of work to build such a thing. Second, writing the code to perform the analyses could be considered as more instructive: it requires one to actually *think* about the analysis, rather than just clicking on buttons.
    + Pretty visualization of fMRI data. Although there is basic functionality for showing slices of fMRI data (through ``cosmo_plot_slices``, for better visualization we suggest to use either your preferred fMRI analysis package, or MRIcron_.

    Also, it does not make coffee for you.

**Does it integrate with PyMVPA?**
    Yes. Dataset structures are pretty much identical in CoSMoMVPA_ (PyMVPA_ provided inspiration for the data structures). The ``mvpa2/datasets/cosmo.py`` module in PyMVPA_ provides input and output support between CoSMoMVPA and PyMVPA datasets and neighborhoods. This means that, for example, searchlights defined in CoSMoMVPA can be run in PyMVPA (possibly benefitting from its multi-threaded implementation), and the results converted back to CoSMoMVPA format.

**Does it run on Octave?**
    Allmost all functionality runs in Octave_, including unit tests through MOxUnit_, but there may be parts that function not so well:

        - Unit tests require MOxUnit_ (because xUnit_ uses object-oriented features not supported by Octave_), and doc-tests are not supported in MOxUnit_ (because Octave_ does not provide ``evalc_``.
        - Support of visualization of MEEG results in FieldTrip_ is limited, because FieldTrip_ provided limited Octave_ compatibility.
        - BrainVoyager_ support through NeuroElf_ is not supported, because NeuroElf_ uses object-oriented features not supported by Octave_.


**How fast does it run?**
    CoSMoMVPA_ is not a speed monster, but on our hardware (Macbook Pro early 2012) a searchlight using typical fMRI data takes one minute for simple analyses (correlation split-half), and a few minutes for more advanced analyses (classifier with cross-validation). Analyses on regions of interest are typically completed in seconds.

**What should I use as input for MVPA?**
    We suggest the following:

    * fMRI options:

        - Apply the GLM for each run seperately, with separate predictors for each condition. Each run is a chunk, and each experimental condition is a target. You can use either beta estimates or t-statistics.
        - Split the data in halves (even and odd) and apply the GLM to each of these (i.e. treat the experiment as consisting of two 'runs'). In this case there are two chunks, and the same number of unique targets as there are experimental conditions.

    * MEEG options:

        - Assign chunks based on the run number
        - If the data in different trials in the same run can be assumed to be independent, use unique chunk values for each trial. If that gives you a lot of chunks (which makes crossvalidation slow), use :ref:`cosmo_chunkize`.

**Who are the developers of CoSMoMVPA?**
    Currently the developers are Nikolaas N. Oosterhof and Andrew C. Connolly. In the code you may find their initials (``NNO``, ``ACC``) in commented header sections.

**Which classifiers are available?**
    + Naive Bayes (:ref:`cosmo_classify_naive_bayes`).
    + Nearest neighbor (:ref:`cosmo_classify_nn`).
    + k-nearest neighbor (:ref:`cosmo_classify_knn`).
    + Support Vector Machine (:ref:`cosmo_classify_svm`; requires the Matlab ``stats`` or ``bioinfo`` toolbox, or LIBSVM_).
    + Linear Discriminant Analysis (:ref:`cosmo_classify_lda`).

**Which platforms does it support?**
    It has been tested with Windows, Mac and Linux.

**What future features can be expected?**
    Time permitting, there are some features that may be added in the future:

    + MEEG source analysis support.
    + Snippets of useful code no the website.

**How can I contact the developers?**
    Please send an email to a@c or b@d, where a=andrew.c.connolly, b=nikolaas.oosterhof, c=dartmouth.edu, d=unitn.it.

**Is there a mailinglist?**
    There is the `CoSMoMVPA Google group`_.
