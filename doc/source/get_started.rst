^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CoSMoMVPA_ requires:

- a working installation of Matlab_.
- the CoSMoMVPA Matlab code; it can be downloaded :ref:`here <download>`.
    + Alternatively, ``git`` users can clone the repository directly through ``git clone https://github.com/CoSMoMVPA/CoSMoMVPA.git``.
    + see also  :ref:`here <download>` for external toolboxes that provide support for other reading from and writing to other file formats, including AFNI_ and BrainVoyager_
- An :ref:`advanced beginner level <matlab_experience>`, or higher, of experience in Matlab programming.
- An :ref:`advanced beginner level <cogneuro_experience>` of cognitive neuroscience (fMRI) data analysis.
- A basic understanding of :ref:`MVPA concepts <mvpa_concepts>`.
- Familiarity with :ref:`CoSMoMVPA concepts <cosmomvpa_concepts>`, in particular the :ref:`cosmomvpa_dataset`, :ref:`cosmomvpa_classifier` and :ref:`cosmomvpa_measure` concepts.

After fulfilling these requirements, you can: 

- familiarize yourself with CoSMoMVPA by looking at some :ref:`runnable examples <modindex_run>` (and look at the `Matlab outputs`_).
- try the :ref:`exercises <ex_toc>`.
- have a look at the :ref:`CoSMoMVPA functions <modindex>`.
