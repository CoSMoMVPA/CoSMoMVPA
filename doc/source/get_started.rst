^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using CoSMoMVPA_ effectively requires:

- a working installation of Matlab_.
- the CoSMoMVPA Matlab source code:
    + ``git`` users:: 

        git clone https://github.com/CoSMoMVPA/CoSMoMVPA.git

    + alternatively, download the `zip archive`_.
  In Matlab_, add the ``mvpa`` and ``external`` directories (and their subdirectories) to the Matlab path.
- optionally the tutorial data, available :ref:`here <download>` (to run the :ref:`exercises <ex_toc>`).
- optionally some external toolboxes for AFNI, BrainVoyager, and/or FieldTrip file support; see :ref:`here <download>`.
- an :ref:`advanced beginner level <matlab_experience>` of experience in Matlab programming is recommended.
- an :ref:`advanced beginner level <cogneuro_experience>` of fMRI or MEEG data analysis is recommended.
- a basic understanding of :ref:`MVPA concepts <mvpa_concepts>`.
- familiarity with :ref:`CoSMoMVPA concepts <cosmomvpa_concepts>`, in particular the :ref:`cosmomvpa_dataset`, :ref:`cosmomvpa_classifier` and :ref:`cosmomvpa_measure` concepts.

Next steps
^^^^^^^^^^

Once you are ready:

- look at the :ref:`runnable examples <modindex_run>` and the associated `Matlab outputs`_.
- try the :ref:`exercises <ex_toc>`.
- explore the :ref:`CoSMoMVPA functions <modindex>`.
