Use the searchlight with a classifier and a cross-validation measure
====================================================================

In this exercise we bring the generic cosmo_cross_validation_accuracy_measure_
and cosmo_searchlight_ functions together, by applying the measure to each searchlight location.

With the help of these functions, run n-fold cross validation and use a nearest neighbor classifier to compute accuracy maps. Visualize the output map and show a histogram of the classification accuracies.
